<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript</p>
<p>I based this project around utilizing an API. I wanted to use all my skills to create a project that was fun, responsive and stylish.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I learned that JavaScript does not shuffle data properly. I had to learn about the Fisher-Yates Shuffle, an algorithm that properly shuffles elements, in this case, of an array. I also utilized how to properly use an API and that <a href="postman.co">Postman.co</a> is very useful in testing what an API produces. I plan to utilize more APIs for future projects and I cannot wait to get them started.</p>
